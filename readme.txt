Advanced What should we write next about? plugin allows users to leave a quick feedback at the end of your posts.

== Description ==
# Advanced What to write next about?

This is plugin is based and inspired by "What should we write about next" by Vladimir prelovac.

AWTW was created from stratch to avoid spams by adding Akismet support which marks feedbacks as Spam and removing email feature which was in the plugin made by prelovac.

The feedbacks are sent by AJAX, and the plugin has a backened panel for moderating Feedbacks where you can mark feedbacks as Spam, Approve or even delete them after reading.

This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

1. Upload `advanced-what-to-write` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
